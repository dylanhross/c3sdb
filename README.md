# C3SDB (Combined Collision Cross Section DataBase)
__Dylan H. Ross__
 

## Overview
__C3SDB__ is an aggregation of large collision cross section (CCS) collections 
covering many diverse chemical classes and measured on a number of different 
instruments. The basic criteria for inclusion in the database are:
* sufficiently large collection of values (~100 minimum)
* publicly available
* performed in Nitrogen drift gas
* reliable measurements; general agreement between datasets on overlapping values


The purpose of this database is to be able to use large-scale CCS collections, 
either individually or in user-defined combinations, for building predictive CCS 
models using machine learning or other techniques.
